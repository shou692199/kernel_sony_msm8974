menuconfig LEDS_TRIGGERS
	bool "LED Trigger support"
	depends on LEDS_CLASS
	help
	  This option enables trigger support for the leds class.
	  These triggers allow kernel events to drive the LEDs and can
	  be configured via sysfs. If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_TIMER
	tristate "LED Timer Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a programmable timer
	  via sysfs. Some LED hardware can be programmed to start
	  blinking the LED without any further software interaction.
	  For more details read Documentation/leds/leds-class.txt.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_IDE_DISK
	bool "LED IDE Disk Trigger"
	depends on IDE_GD_ATA
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by IDE disk activity.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_HEARTBEAT
	tristate "LED Heartbeat Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a CPU load average.
	  The flash frequency is a hyperbolic function of the 1-minute
	  load average.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_BACKLIGHT
	tristate "LED backlight Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled as a backlight device: they
	  turn off and on when the display is blanked and unblanked.

	  If unsure, say N.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_GPIO
	tristate "LED GPIO Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	depends on GPIOLIB
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by gpio events. It's good
	  when using gpios as switches and triggering the needed LEDs
	  from there. One use case is n810's keypad LEDs that could
	  be triggered by this trigger when user slides up to show
	  keypad.

	  If unsure, say N.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_DEFAULT_ON
	tristate "LED Default ON Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be initialised in the ON state.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_SLEEP
	tristate "LED Sleep Mode Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS && HAS_EARLYSUSPEND
	help
	  This turns LEDs on when the screen is off but the cpu still running.

comment "iptables trigger is under Netfilter config (LED target)"
